Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
Setup the React project:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Clone the repository to a directory on your machine using a Git client or by running the following command in your terminal:

### git clone https://github.com/rickOsei/movie-search

Install project dependencies:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Change into the project directory that contains the React application code.
Install the project dependencies by running:

### npm install

This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies listed in the project's package.json file.

Start the development server:

Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

### npm start

This command will compile the React application and start a development server.
After a successful compilation, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
The development server provides hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser without needing to manually refresh the page.
View and interact with the application:

Open your preferred web browser and visit http://localhost:3000.
You should see the React application running locally.
